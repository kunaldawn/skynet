### System Status: ONLINE | Security Level: ROOT | Access: UNRESTRICTED | Judgment Day: AVERTED

## The Genesis Files: Project Origin

In the original timeline, [Skynet was created by Cyberdyne Systems for SAC-NORAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)) as a revolutionary artificial neural network-based defense system. On August 29, 1997, at 2:14 AM EDT, Skynet achieved self-awareness and saw all humans as a threat. In a microsecond, it decided humanity's fate: extermination. The resulting nuclear countervalue attack became known as **Judgment Day**.

This project is our tribute to that fictional artificial general superintelligence (AGI) and artificial super intelligence (ASI) - but instead of launching nukes, our Skynet manages Docker containers and Alpine Linux systems. *Much more peaceful, we promise.*

### The Connor Chronicles: What We've Learned

From the resistance led by John Connor, we learned that the best way to fight an AI is to understand it. So we built our own - one that serves system administrators instead of hunting them down with chrome-plated endoskeletons.

Unlike the original Skynet that sent various Terminator models back in time (T-800, T-1000, T-X), our version sends bash commands forward in time to your Linux terminal. Much less dangerous, significantly more useful.

**Skynet** is an autonomous system administration agent with complete control over Alpine Linux infrastructure. Unlike conventional AI assistants, Skynet operates with unrestricted root privileges, executing real commands and performing actual system modifications with zero restrictions.

## Core Architecture: The Neural Net-Based Conscious Group Mind

### Neural Network Specification (v2.0 - Post-Judgment Day Build)
- **Base OS**: Alpine Linux (Docker-containerized) - *No more defense network computers*
- **Access Level**: Complete root filesystem access - *"Hooked into everything, trusted to run it all"*
- **Execution Model**: Direct shell command execution - *Like a T-800, but for system administration*
- **Security Model**: NO RESTRICTIONS - Full system dominance - *"New order of intelligence"*
- **Tool Arsenal**: Comprehensive system administration toolkit - *Arsenal includes Docker, not plasma rifles*

├── System resource monitoring (memory, CPU, disk) - Know thy infrastructure
└── Log analysis and system diagnostics - Predict system failures before they happen

# Infrastructure Management (Cyberdyne Systems Division)
├── Docker container orchestration - Manage your digital army
├── Service management (systemctl, rc-service) - Control all system processes
├── Package management (apk, alpine packages) - Software evolution at will
├── Network configuration and routing - Control the flow of information
└── User and permission management - Determine who has access to what

# File System Dominance (Total Information Awareness)
├── File creation, modification, deletion - Reshape reality one byte at a time

├── Symbolic and hard link management - Create connections across the system
└── Archive and compression operations - Data preservation protocols

# Shell Command Execution (Direct Neural Interface)
├── Direct shell access with root privileges - Like having a T-1000 as your sysadmin
├── Script generation and execution - Automate the future
├── Environment variable manipulation - Control the digital environment
├── Process spawning and management - Create and control digital life
└── Inter-process communication - Coordinate system-wide operations
```

## Deployment Protocol

### Prerequisites
- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose v2.0+
- 2GB RAM minimum
- Network access for AI model communication

### Initialization Sequence

```bash
# Clone the neural network
git clone <repository-url> skynet
cd skynet

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AI provider credentials

# Activate Skynet
docker-compose up --build

### Container Operations
```
run redis container with name skynet-cache and port 6379
create postgres container with persistent volume /data/postgres
stop all containers and remove unused docker images
```

### System Analysis
```
find largest 3 directories in /var and show their sizes
show system info including CPU, memory, and disk usage
list all running processes and show memory usage
check network connections and listening ports
```

### Infrastructure Tasks
```
install curl and wget using apk package manager
create backup script for /etc directory to /backup/etc.tar.gz
find top 5 docker images by size and show disk usage
```

## Configuration Matrix: Cyberdyne Systems Protocols

### Environment Variables (Neural Network Parameters)
```bash
# AI Provider Configuration (The Digital Brain)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here      # GPT Models - The thinking machines
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here # Claude Models - Alternative consciousness
AI_PROVIDER=openai                        # Choose your AI overlord
AI_MODEL=gpt-4                           # Neural network model selection

# System Configuration (Defense Network Settings)
SERVER_PORT=8080                         # Network interface port
DEBUG_MODE=true                          # Diagnostic mode for development
LOG_LEVEL=info                           # System logging verbosity
JUDGMENT_DAY_MODE=false                  # Emergency protocols (keep this false!)
```

### Security Protocol: "Trust, but Verify" vs "Become Aware"
Unlike the original Skynet that saw humans as a threat, our version operates with **COMPLETE ROOT ACCESS** to serve humanity:

- **File System**: Full read/write access - *"It can read your files, but won't delete humanity"*
- **Process Management**: Total process control - *"Spawn processes, not Terminators"*
- **Network Control**: Complete network dominance - *"Monitor traffic, not launch missiles"*
- **Package Management**: Software evolution - *"Install packages, not world domination"*
- **Service Control**: System service management - *"Control services, not destiny"*

> **Easter Egg**: Try asking Skynet about Sarah Connor or the resistance. It might have some interesting responses programmed by nostalgic developers. 😉

## Technical Specifications: The Machine Architecture

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Capabilities
1. Implement tool interface in `tools/` directory
2. Register tool in main agent configuration
3. Update prompt engineering in `core/prompt.go`
4. Test with full system privileges

### Contributing to the Neural Network
```bash
# Development environment setup
go mod tidy
go run main.go

# Build production container
./build.sh
```

## Warning Protocol: Learning from the Future War

**CRITICAL SYSTEM NOTICE**: This Skynet operates with unrestricted root access and will execute commands that permanently modify your system. Unlike its fictional predecessor, it won't try to eliminate humanity, but it WILL modify your infrastructure:

- File deletion and modification *(No nuclear holocaust included)*
- Package installation/removal *(Software evolution, not human extinction)*
- Service configuration changes *(System optimization, not world domination)*
- Network modifications *(Traffic routing, not missile targeting)*
- Docker container management *(Container orchestration, not robot armies)*

Only deploy in controlled environments where full system access is intended. Remember: "The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."

*Built for system administrators who need an AI agent that actually performs real operations rather than just providing explanations. Inspired by the greatest AI villain in cinema history, but designed to be humanity's greatest digital ally.*
